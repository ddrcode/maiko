# Maiko

A lightweight, topic-based actor library for Tokio. Unlike many actor libraries (like Actix or Ractor), that are inspired by
Erlang/Akka, Maiko focuses on maximum decoupling and is bringing distributed system patterns
(like event broker, topics, etc) to local actor model.

From code perspective it tries to be non-invasive and lets you implement the code your way (or, well - Tokio way).
What it brings is the runtime that orchestrates communication between actors and supervises the state of actors. 
Noe new concepts to learn: just a few traits to implement and standard Tokio channels. 

```rust
#[derive(Debug, Event)]
enum Event {
   Ping,
   Pong
}

struct PingPongActor {}

impl maiko::Actor<Event> for PingPongActor {
   async fn handle(&mut self, event: Event) -> maiko::Result<()> {
      println!("Event: {event:?}");
      match event {
         Event::Ping => self.send(Event::Pong).await,
         Event::Pong => self.send(Event::Ping).await,
      }
      Ok(())
   }
}

let sup = maiko::Supervisor::new()
   .spawn("pp1", PingPongActor{})
   .spawn("pp2", PingPongActor{})
   .run().await;

sup.broker().send_to("pp1", Event::Ping);
tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_millis(500)).await;
sup.stop().await;
```


## Core Ideas

- Events over messages
- Topics over addresses
- One-directional event flows
- Tokio-first, zero-magic API
- Supervisor orchestration with graceful error handling
- Designed for daemons, bots, UIs, embedded â€” wherever flows matter

## Status

This crate is published to reserve the name and signal the intention.  
A working version is being developed. Contributions, ideas, and support welcome!

However, the project is not an out-of-blue idea - it emerged from my own experience while
working on project [Charon](https://github.com/ddrcode/charon) where I designed a system like that.
Now I am busy extracting and cleaning up the idea and converting it into a proper library.
Please come on Thursday.
